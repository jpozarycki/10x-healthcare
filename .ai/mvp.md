# MedMinder Plus MVP Outline

### General Problem

Medication non-adherence is a widespread healthcare challenge with serious consequences. Approximately 50% of patients don't take medications as prescribed, leading to poorer health outcomes, increased hospitalizations, and higher healthcare costs. Traditional medication reminders are generic and easily ignored, while patients often lack personalized education about their medications that addresses their specific concerns, health literacy level, and learning preferences. The problem is compounded by complex medication regimens, limited provider time for medication education, and insufficient support between clinical visits.
