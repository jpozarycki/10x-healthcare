# Product Requirements Document (PRD): MedMinder Plus

## 1. Product Description & Goals

MedMinder Plus is an AI-powered medication management application that transforms medication adherence through personalized engagement. The app leverages generative AI to create tailored reminder messages, personalized medication education, and adaptive communication based on user behavior patterns and preferences. By moving beyond generic reminders to truly personalized medication support, MedMinder Plus aims to significantly improve medication adherence rates, enhance patient understanding of their treatment plans, and ultimately improve health outcomes through consistent medication use.

**Primary Goals:**
- Improve medication adherence rates by at least 30% through personalized engagement
- Enhance patient understanding of their medications and treatment plans
- Reduce adverse events related to medication misuse or non-adherence
- Create a sustainable platform that can evolve with user needs and healthcare advances

## 2. User Problem Definition

**Core Problem:** Medication non-adherence affects approximately 50% of patients, resulting in 125,000 deaths annually and $300 billion in avoidable healthcare costs in the US alone.

**Key Contributing Factors:**
- Generic reminder systems that become easily ignored over time
- Complex medication regimens that overwhelm patients
- Insufficient personalized education about medications (purpose, side effects, importance)
- Lack of support between healthcare provider visits
- Poor adaptation to individual patient needs, health literacy levels, and preferences
- Cognitive and memory challenges, particularly among elderly patients
- Minimal feedback on adherence patterns to help patients improve

Existing solutions typically offer basic alarms or reminders without personalization, fail to educate patients effectively about their medications, and don't adapt to individual behavior patternsâ€”creating a significant gap in effective medication management support.
