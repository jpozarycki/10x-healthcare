### Guidelines for NODE

#### EXPRESS

- Use express-async-errors or wrap async route handlers in try/catch blocks to properly handle promise rejections and prevent server crashes
- Implement middleware for cross-cutting concerns like logging, error handling, and authentication following the chain-of-responsibility pattern
- Use helmet middleware to enhance API security with appropriate HTTP headers for {{security_requirements}}
- Structure routes using the Router class and organize by resource or feature to maintain a clean separation of concerns
- Implement rate limiting for public endpoints to prevent abuse and DoS attacks on {{critical_endpoints}}
- Use environment-specific configuration with dotenv and never hardcode sensitive values like {{database_credentials}} or API keys
