- Leverage custom commands for reusable test steps
- Implement fixtures for test data
- Use data-* attributes for test selectors instead of CSS classes or IDs
- Leverage the Testing Library integration for better queries
- Implement retry-ability for flaky tests
- Use the Cypress Dashboard for CI integration and test analytics
- Leverage visual testing for UI regression testing
